## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Three-stage classification cascade: filename, content, then file type.
- Content extraction with graceful multi-backend fallback (pdftotext, textutil,
  pypdf, python-docx, openpyxl, plain text).
- Generic default categories shipped in `config/default.toml`.
- TOML configuration with default + user-file + CLI-override merging.
- CLI: `plan`, `run`, `undo`, `watch`, `install`, `uninstall`, `status`, `doctor`.
- Undo journal: every run is recorded so `cubby undo` can revert it.
- Opt-in `dedupe` to drop byte-identical duplicate downloads.
- `cubby plan --json` for scripting.
- Background agent support via launchd (macOS) and systemd (Linux).
- Collision-safe moves, age delay, and skipping of in-progress downloads.
- Portable `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh`.
- Test suite covering the engine, adapters, use cases and CLI, plus a fuzz test.
